        <p>It is impossible for a self-acting machine, unaided by any external agency,<br>
         to convey heat from one body to another at a higher temperature.</p>

    <p>It is the destiny of wine to be drunk, 
        and it is the destiny of glucose to be oxidized.
        But it was not oxidized immediately: 
        <br>* Its drinker kept it in his liver for more than a week, 
        well curled up and tranquil,<br> 
        as a reserve aliment for a sudden effort;
        an effort that he was forced to make the following Sunday, 
        pursuing a bolting horse.<br> 
        Farewell to the hexagonal structure:<br>* in the space of a few instants the skein was unwound and became glucose again, 
        and this was dragged by the bloodstream all the way to a minute muscle fiber in the thigh, 
        and here brutally split into two molecules of lactic acid,<br> 
        the grim harbinger of fatigue: only later, some minutes after, 
        the panting of the lungs was able to supply the oxygen necessary to quietly oxidize the latter. 
        <br>* So a new molecule of carbon dioxide returned to the atmosphere,<br> 
        and a parcel of the energy that the sun had handed to the vine-shoot passed from the state of chemical energy to that of mechanical energy, 
        and thereafter settled down in the slothful condition of heat,<br> 
        warming up imperceptibly the air moved by the running and the blood of the runner. 
        <br>'Such is life,' although rarely is it described in this manner:<br> an inserting itself, 
        a drawing off to its advantage, a parasitizing of the downward course of energy, 
        from its noble solar form to the degraded one of low-temperature heat. 
        <br>* In this downward course, which leads to equilibrium and thus death, 
        life draws a bend and nests in it.</p>
